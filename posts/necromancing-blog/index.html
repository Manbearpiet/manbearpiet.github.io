  <h2 id="starting-to-blog-again">Starting to blog again</h2>
<p>The last few years have been great for me.</p>
<p>My girlfriend and I bought a house üè°, and we&rsquo;ve done all sorts of DIY I wouldn&rsquo;t dream of being able to.
I learned it&rsquo;s great fun to do because you can immediately see/bear the the fruits of your work.
It was tiring, which was one of the reasons I didn&rsquo;t pursue blogging anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had success with my team, I started a new team with a valued colleague of mine, primarily focused on Deployment and Automation üöÄ (DNA).
This was a large step from the usual break/fix day to day of my previous team, although we were mostly involved in building new solutions.
So, more PowerShell, Bicep, Azure DevOps, and GitHub for us now, although I see more and more cool stuff coming from our Managed Services team, I could learn a lot from them. Our DNA-team is growing and we&rsquo;ve some new challenges we want to overcome, and goals and we want to accomplish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had two challenges within my blog, one was that I was so hard-focused on the quality of posts that none of my drafts was good enough.
This meant that I had prior to this post, 12 draft articles on all kinds of things that just weren&rsquo;t up to standard, nor I had the motivation to get them there.</p>
<p>My other challenge was more or less related to that, I never seemed to have found peace with my past career change.
I&rsquo;ve had years of chasing a potential med-school position, but each time it just didn&rsquo;t work out, either financially or I didn&rsquo;t pass a certain test.
This duped my confidence in my capabilities to learn things and since then I more or less avoided challenges.
From time to time, I would find something cool in Azure or DevOps and learn a lot about it, as I was used to on all the med stuff, but it would fade away after that. My blogs followed this cadence, a sudden spike of motivation and, then nothing.</p>
<p>This, atop our moving houses and DIY things, led to no more blogging. But over the past few months, I found some renewed confidence again.
I made a little peace with my past and found some motivation to blog again. I also learned you can read all the fancy quotes on coping with failure as a topic, but you don&rsquo;t know until you know. My blogs don&rsquo;t have to be perfect, but if there might be some/any value in them for anyone, then it&rsquo;s there for them.</p>
<p>I dumped all my previous draft blogs and will start writing some new ones soon.
I have to do something with that paid-for domain anyway right üòÑ.
Lastly I moved to a new Hugo theme with minimal JS in it and removed tracking via Azure Application Insights.</p>
