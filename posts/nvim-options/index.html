While Neovim works lovely out of the box with its default settings, you might want to customize it to your liking. In this post, I&rsquo;ll show you how to set options and keybindings in Neovim using Lua.
Lua?
Lua is a lightweight, high-level programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is often used as a scripting language in applications and games. Neovim has built-in support for Lua, which allows you to configure and extend Neovim using Lua scripts." />

<p>In Tutor Lesson 7.3 &ldquo;Configuring NVIM&rdquo;, there are instructions on how to set up your <code>init.lua</code> file, which is the main configuration file for Neovim. You could also use <code>init.vim</code>, but since I&rsquo;ve tried just Lua, I&rsquo;ll stick to that.</p>
