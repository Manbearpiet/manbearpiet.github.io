      <description>OS-hardening security auditing What? I wanted to check compliance vs. a security baseline for OS-hardening without using Qualys. Not that I dislike it or don&amp;rsquo;t want to use it (on the contrary!), I was just curious how to audit OS-level settings from Azure or Azure DevOps. My primary goal was to check out how to validate our own internal security controls. For production environments I tend to stick to Qualys for vulnerability assessment, but also want to add another control layer.</description>

      <description>Blog! Blarg! Blorg!? Why? Sometimes I have decent&amp;rsquo;ish ideas to solve challenges faced on the Microsoft Azure cloud, using Azure DevOps or with PowerShell. If there&amp;rsquo;s code involved with solving these problems, that code tends to disappear in a folder I&amp;rsquo;ve accordingly named Trash. I frequently hear from colleagues and read tweets of people struggling with the same challenges.
This blog will mostly feature my noobish take on challenges with these topics.</description>
