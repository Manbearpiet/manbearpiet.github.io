      <description>Azure Policy as a configuration engine? Azure Policy Guest Configuration In a previous blog, I showed how to audit your GPO-contained settings inside Azure VM&amp;rsquo;s using Azure Policy Guest Configuration. The packaging process is a bit too much for some, and in some cases, you only need to perform a few configuration settings. Luckily there are some settings you can already configure with built-in policies. In this blog, I will show you what Azure Policies are and how they are assigned.</description>

      <description>Azure Front Door Frequently I speak to cloud admins and consultants who&amp;rsquo;ve heard about Azure Front Door, but are not sure about what it does or havent interacted with it. I have some experience deploying and managing Front Door instances of customers. Most heard comment is: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a thing that does something with application delivery, right?&amp;rdquo;. In the near future I want pursue on the AZ-700 certification, so I thought a win-win in blogging about!</description>

      <title>Auditing GPOs with Azure Guest Configuration Policy</title>

      <description>OS-hardening security auditing What? I wanted to check compliance of a security baseline on Azure without first applying it via DSC. My primary goal was to check out how to validate our own internal security controls without using GPO&amp;rsquo;s.
Group Policy Objects are frequently used within a windows server domain to push settings, like security controls, and validate/reapply them to prevent configuration drift. My challenge was how to audit these settings, while knowing some customers also use Demilitarized Zones (DMZ&amp;rsquo;s) in Azure.</description>

      <description>Blog! Blarg! Blorg!? Why? Sometimes I have decent&amp;rsquo;ish ideas to solve challenges faced on the Microsoft Azure cloud, using Azure DevOps or with PowerShell. If there&amp;rsquo;s code involved with solving these problems, that code tends to disappear in a folder I&amp;rsquo;ve accordingly named Trash. I frequently hear from colleagues and read tweets of people struggling with the same challenges.
This blog will mostly feature my noobish take on challenges with these topics.</description>
