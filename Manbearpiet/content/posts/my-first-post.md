# Blog! Blarg! Blorg!?

## Why?

Sometimes I have decent'ish ideas to solve challenges faced on the Microsoft Azure cloud, using Azure DevOps or with PowerShell. If there's code involved with solving these problems, that code tends to disappear in a folder I've accordingly named `Trash`. I frequently hear from colleagues and read tweets from people struggling with the same challenges. This blog will mostly feature my noobish take on challenges with these topics. By writing this blog I hope to improve my web-dev skills and hope to help someone facing earlier mentioned challenges.

## How

I reached out earlier on the PowerShell discord (amazing community), I told the members on the _#bridge_ I had the idea to start a blog, but had no writing experience nor the idea on how to start a blog technically.  I was hinted to use GitHub Pages and Hugo and that it should be fairly easy to set up and go.

The nice thing about Hugo is that it allows me to write content in Markdown, which I'm ok with. My webdev-skills (both front- and back-end) are non-existant. So Hugo it is!

I read a blog where someone explained the steps [link](https://earvingad.github.io/posts/blogwithhugo/)

From this blog I learned

- How to setup Hugo
- How to use GitHub Pages for my Hugo based website
- And how to install a theme for my Hugo based static website
