            <description>Blog! Blarg! Blorg!? Why? Sometimes I have decent&amp;rsquo;ish ideas to solve challenges faced on the Microsoft Azure cloud, using Azure DevOps or with PowerShell. If there&amp;rsquo;s code involved with solving these problems, that code tends to disappear in a folder I&amp;rsquo;ve accordingly named Trash. I frequently hear from colleagues and read tweets of people struggling with the same challenges.
This blog will mostly feature my noobish take on challenges with these topics.</description>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Sometimes I have decent&rsquo;ish ideas to solve challenges faced on the Microsoft Azure cloud, using Azure DevOps or with PowerShell.
If there&rsquo;s code involved with solving these problems, that code tends to disappear in a folder I&rsquo;ve accordingly named <code>Trash</code>.
I frequently hear from colleagues and read tweets of people struggling with the same challenges.</p>
<p>This blog will mostly feature my noobish take on challenges with these topics.
By writing this blog I hope to improve my webdev and writing skills, but mostly try to help readers facing earlier mentioned challenges.</p>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<p>Years ago I did an attempt using a cheap hosting service and WordPress, that just wouldn&rsquo;t look like I wanted it to. I didn&rsquo;t ask for help and just let it bleed out.
To prevent the same error, I reached out earlier on the <a href="https://aka.ms/psdiscord">PowerShell discord</a> (amazing community). I told the members on the <em>#bridge</em> I had the idea to start a blog, but had no writing experience nor the idea on how to start a blog technically.  I was hinted to use GitHub Pages and Hugo and that it should be fairly easy to set up and go.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Hugo is that it allows me to write content in Markdown, which I&rsquo;m ok with. My webdev-skills are non-existant. So Hugo it is!</p>
<p>I read a blog where someone explained the steps <a href="https://earvingad.github.io/posts/blogwithhugo/">link</a></p>
<p>From this blog I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to setup Hugo</li>
<li>How to use GitHub Pages for my Hugo based website</li>
<li>And how to install a theme for my Hugo based static website</li>
</ul>
<p>Before reading I was still looking toward hosting on a VPS (because new things like GitHub Pages are scary!), but reading eaarvingad his blog I had to give it a try.</p>
<h2 id="lets-go">Let&rsquo;s go</h2>
<p>So I created a private repository on GitHub, and you&rsquo;re looking at my first commit.
All in all setting up took less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>My first choice was a minimalistic blog theme, but it didn&rsquo;t scale nicely with my content. Most of the extensive themes require seperate NPM packages, then I chose the the ananke theme it looks nice and doesn&rsquo;t really require all the bells and whistles.
But when I was reading the draft I almost was blinded by the white background. So I switched to <strong>hello-friend-ng</strong> by rhazdon on github <a href="https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng">link</a>.</p>
<p>This has a nice implementation which uses your system preference (light/dark).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all the tips of the PowerShell discord members really helped, using Hugo and the right theme gives you an awesome experience.
While it is published under the MIT-license I really like Drodje Atlialp his theme so I bought him a coffee, if you like your theme please do the same!</p>
