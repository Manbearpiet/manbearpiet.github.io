      <description>Azure Front Door Frequently I speak to cloud admins and consultants who&amp;rsquo;ve heard about Azure Front Door, but are not sure about what it does or havent interacted with it. I have some experience deploying and managing Front Door instances of customers. Most heard comment is: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a thing that does something with application delivery, right?&amp;rdquo;. In the near future I want pursue on the AZ-700 certification, so I thought a win-win in blogging about!</description>
