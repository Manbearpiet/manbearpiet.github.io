      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;starting-to-blog-again&#34;&gt;Starting to blog again&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last few years have been great for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend and I bought a house 🏡, and we&amp;rsquo;ve done all sorts of DIY I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dream of being able to.&#xA;I learned it&amp;rsquo;s great fun to do because you can immediately see/bear the the fruits of your work.&#xA;It was tiring, which was one of the reasons I didn&amp;rsquo;t pursue blogging anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had success with my team, I started a new team with a valued colleague of mine, primarily focused on Deployment and Automation 🚀 (DNA).&#xA;This was a large step from the usual break/fix day to day of my previous team, although we were mostly involved in building new solutions.&#xA;So, more PowerShell, Bicep, Azure DevOps, and GitHub for us now, although I see more and more cool stuff coming from our Managed Services team, I could learn a lot from them. Our DNA-team is growing and we&amp;rsquo;ve some new challenges we want to overcome, and goals and we want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
