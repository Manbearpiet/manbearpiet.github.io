      <description>Starting to blog again The last few years have been great for me.
My girlfriend and I bought a house üè°, and we&amp;rsquo;ve done all sorts of DIY I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dream of being able to. I learned it&amp;rsquo;s great fun to do because you can immediately see/bear the the fruits of your work. It was tiring, which was one of the reasons I didn&amp;rsquo;t pursue blogging anymore.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had success with my team, I started a new team with a valued colleague of mine, primarily focused on Deployment and Automation üöÄ (DNA).</description>
