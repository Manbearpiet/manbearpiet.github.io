      <description>OS-hardening security auditing What? I wanted to check compliance of a security baseline on Azure without first applying it via DSC. My primary goal was to check out how to validate our own internal security controls without using GPO&amp;rsquo;s.
Group Policy Objects are frequently used within a windows server domain to push settings, like security controls, and validate/reapply them to prevent configuration drift. My challenge was how to audit these settings, while knowing some customers also use Demilitarized Zones (DMZ&amp;rsquo;s) in Azure.</description>
