      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we were running into issues because our pipelines in GitHub Actions were taking too long to authenticate to the Azure platform using the &lt;code&gt;azure/login&lt;/code&gt; action with federated credentials. Initially it took around 25-30 seconds to authenticate, but over time this increased to over 3-4 minutes, which is not acceptable in our CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I decided to investigate the issue and found a workaround that significantly speeds up the authentication process.&#xA;In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share how I managed to reduce the authentication time from several minutes to just a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
